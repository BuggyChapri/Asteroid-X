# 🎮 **Asteroid Velocity**  

### 🌟 **About**  
Originally made for **Lame Game Jam** (*btw got 7th place with a 3-star rating* 🌟🌟🌟).  

🕹️ In a dark, forgotten corner of the city, there's an old, rundown arcade that hasn’t been touched in decades. People say strange things happen to those who enter after midnight. The rumors speak of a cursed machine—an arcade cabinet that once swallowed the souls of the unfortunate who dared to play. That machine’s name was **"Asteroid Velocity"**.
